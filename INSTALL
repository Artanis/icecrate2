Installing Icecrate
===================

Step 1: Install
---------------
::

    pip install git+https://github.com/Artanis/icecrate2.git#egg=icecrate2

OR

::
    
    git clone https://github.com/Artanis/icecrate2.git
    cd icecrate2
    python setup.py install

Step 2: External Dependencies
-----------------------------

Pip and setup.py will resolve most dependencies, however, there are two they
cannot:

* Bower, a node.js utility (`npm install bower`).
* CouchApp, which currently only supports Python 2.

Both these utilities are expected on $PATH.

Step 3: Configure
-----------------

Create a config.ini file at ``$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/icecrate/config.ini``
(``$XDG_CONFIG_HOME`` is usually .config) or ``/etc/icecrate/config.ini``.

Here's a sample config.ini::

    [host]
    addr = localhost
    port = 8000

    [database]
    addr = localhost
    port = 5984
    app_db = icecrate
    app_user = icecrate
    app_passwd = notagoodpassword

    [https]
    certificate = /path/to/ssl_sert.pem

    [oauth.google]
    client_id = 
    client_secret =
    redirect_to = 


Step 4: Setup
-------------

setup the database, push the database-side code to CouchDB, and use
bower to fetch the web dependencies::

    icecrate-bootstrap
