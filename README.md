# Icecrate 2

Icecrate 2 is a home inventory system, taking advantage of smartphones
with the ZXing barcode scanner apps to enter items into the system.

Icecrate 2 is intended to replace
[Icecrate](https://github.com/Artanis/icecrate), which performs most
actions on the a server, with a primarily Javascript application in
which the server manages application data.
